Smart Channel Recommendation System

Tracks channel recommendations and only suggests changes when:
1. There's a genuine problem (overlap, interference)
2. The recommendation hasn't been made recently
3. The current channel is actually problematic

Prevents repeated recommendations for channels that were already changed.
